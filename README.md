# Systemic Crisis Prediction in African Countries

## Overview
The "Systemic Crisis Prediction in African Countries" project aims to predict the likelihood of systemic crises (including banking, financial, and inflation crises) in selected African countries using historical economic data from 1860 to 2014. By analyzing key indicators such as annual inflation rates and exchange rates, this project provides valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders interested in economic stability.
